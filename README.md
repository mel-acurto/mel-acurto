👋 Hi, I’m @mel-acurto

👀 I’m a Mechanical engineer who loves art, technology and sustainability. I'm often designing and building animatronics, props, theater sets, to functional consumer products. You can also find me creating short-films, editing videos, creating some VFX shots during my free time. I would say I'm a Jack-of-all-Trades as I've worked in the past in multiple different sectors as a gym equipment technician, sustainability planner, mechanical designer and as a packaging engineer. 


🌱 I’m constantly learning new topics using python, SQL, C/C++

✨ My page is filled with template codes that I usually use in my projects -- Work Smarter, not Harder!

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with anyone, so...
📫 Feel free to contact me, and I'm more than happy to work on a project together.
